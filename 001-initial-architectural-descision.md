ADR 1: 
    Native, Web, or Hybrid Application?

Status: 
    Accepted

Context:
    The team is tasked with developing a mobile app for a client that allows users to order food from local restaurants for delivery or pickup. The app must enable users to create accounts, save payment information for future orders, and provide a user-friendly interface for seamless navigation and ordering. The following key requirements must be considered:

    Location Tracking - App should accurately track the userâ€™s location to recommend nearby restaurants, estimate delivery times, and display location-based options.

    Real-Time Order Tracking - The app needs to provide real-time updates on the status and progress of orders.

    Payment Integration - App should support various payment gateways to facilitate secure transactions.

    Menu Synchronization - App must integrate with restaurant inventory management systems to ensure up-to-date menus.

    User Reviews and Ratings - App should include functionality for users to leave reviews and ratings for restaurants and food items.

    Order History - App should display users' order history, enabling them to reorder favorite items easily.

    Push Notifications - App must provide timely notifications for order confirmations, delivery updates, and promotional offers.

Decision:
    Native App Development (Swift for iOS and Kotlin for Android)

Justification:
    Developer Experience - All of our team members have been working with the React framework for a decent amount of time now.

    Performance - Native apps offer superior performance, crucial for real-time location tracking, seamless order management, and handling rich media content.

    Real-Time Updates - Native development supports more efficient integration with WebSocket and other real-time data technologies, ensuring smooth order tracking and updates.

    Location Services - Native platforms provide direct access to advanced GPS capabilities and integration with location-based services.

    Secure Payment Integration - Native development allows easier implementation of multiple secure payment gateways.

    User Experience - Native apps can leverage platform-specific design guidelines (e.g., Material Design for Android, Human Interface Guidelines for iOS) to create a consistent and intuitive user interface.

    Advanced Features - Access to device features and push notification services (APNS and FCM) ensures a robust notification system.

Consequences:
    Higher Development Costs - Maintaining separate codebases for iOS and Android increases development time and costs.

    Specialized Skill Requirements - Native development requires expertise in Swift and Kotlin, which may increase the need for more resources.
