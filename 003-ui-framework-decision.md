UI Framework

Status: 
    Accepted

Context:
    App should be a user friendly and intuitive interface to navigate through features such as location-based recommendations, order tracking, menu, etc. React Native was chosen for development so selecting a UI framework compatible with React Native and for supporting the specific needs is essential. eam aims to create an engaging customer experience while leveraging existing skills to streamline the development.

Decision:
    Chosen UI framework is React Native Paper combined with React Native Elements. React Native Paper has material design components, which is suitable for Android and IOS interface guidelines. It also includes a wide range of customizable components such as cards, lists, buttons, etc, that are essential to the core features of the app.
    React Native Elements enhances the UI by providing cross-platform components that simplify the layout customization and the styling - therefore allowing the app to be consistent across IOS and Android. 

Consequences:
    - Efficient Development: Using these frameworks speeds up development as they offer ready-to-use, customizable components that align with both iOS and Android design principles, which helps maintain consistency across platforms.
    - Enhanced User Experience: Material Design components enhance the visual appeal on Android, while customizable styles ensure a smooth adaptation for iOS. This hybrid approach improves the overall user experience by providing a cohesive design that feels native to each platform.
    - Reduced Code Complexity: By leveraging pre-built components, the team can avoid excessive custom styling, reducing the complexity of the codebase and making it easier to maintain and update as the app evolves.
    - Increased Learning Curve: For team members new to React Native Paper or React Native Elements, there may be a slight learning curve. However, the frameworks are well-documented, with a large community and extensive resources that will aid in quickly addressing any challenges.
    - Long-Term Flexibility: As the app grows and new features are added, the flexibility and community support for these UI frameworks will allow for easy updates and continued alignment with design standards, enhancing the appâ€™s scalability.
