Permissions Decisions

1. Location Access
Status: Accepted

Context - 
The app will offer location-based recommendations and store locator features to enhance the user experience by providing contextually relevant suggestions. Access to location data is essential for these features.

Decision - 
The app will request location access, allowing users to receive personalized, location-based recommendations for stores or services nearby. Users will be informed of the data usage, 
and the app will follow platform guidelines for requesting permissions only when necessary.

Consequences -

Improved User Experience: Location-based recommendations create a personalized and convenient experience.
Privacy Compliance: Users will be prompted to grant permissions, with explanations on how the data enhances app functionality, helping to build trust.
Battery Impact: Continuous location access may drain battery life faster, so optimizations will be implemented to minimize usage.

2. Storage Access  
Status: Accepted

Context - 
The app requires access to local storage to store encrypted user financial data for offline use, as well as general app data. This will allow users to track spending data even when offline.

Decision - 
The app will request permission to access local storage on the device. All sensitive data will be encrypted before being stored locally to protect user privacy.

Consequences -

Offline Functionality: Local storage allows the app to function without an internet connection, improving usability.
Enhanced Security: Encrypted storage ensures that financial information remains secure on the userâ€™s device.
User Control: Users will have the option to clear their data from storage, which will delete all locally stored information.

3. Internet Access
Status: Accepted

Context - 
Internet access is necessary to synchronize data with the remote MySQL database, allowing users to view their spending history across multiple devices. 
It also enables secure API calls for data retrieval and updates.

Decision - 
The app will require internet access permissions to enable data synchronization with the MySQL database. Data will be encrypted during transmission to maintain security.

Consequences -

Data Continuity: Users can access their data on any device with an internet connection, enhancing usability.
Security: Encrypted data transmission ensures sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access.
Dependency on Connectivity: Some features, such as data synchronization, will be unavailable without an internet connection.

4. Notification Permissions
Status: Accepted

Context - 
Notifications will improve the user experience by alerting users of spending activity, reminders, and relevant updates.

Decision - 
The app will request permission to send push notifications. Users can control notification preferences in the app settings.

Consequences -

User Engagement: Notifications keep users informed, improving app engagement and usability.
User Control: Users can enable or disable notifications, allowing for a personalized experience.
Potential Disruption: Notifications could be intrusive if not managed well, so the app will avoid excessive or irrelevant notifications.
